# Simple Log In application in PHP

## Summary

This web app consists of two main pages: a Log In and a Sign Up page. Besides, there are two more smaller pages called "error" and "success" that show the result of the two main operations. Each one of these pages has a somewhat responsive style applied so it doesn't look too boring.

These two main pages have HTML forms that respectively trigger **```PHP```** scripts which run queries in a database via the **PDO** (PHP Data Object) system. Specifically to agilize the DB communication process, a couple of classes were written as handlers in files located apart for easier access.

Said database was built in **```MySQL```** and it was entirely dumped in a ".sql" file in the same repository. This database is called "php_test" and has its only table: "users". The *users* table has four columns: **Id**, **Username**, **PasswordSalt** and **PasswordHash**. Yes, the passwords are stored as hashes generated by the MD5 algorithm (which outputs a hash of 32 bytes long).
